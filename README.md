# Files Flattener

This repository contains implementations for recursively reading all files in a specified directory and outputting their filenames and contents to a specified output file.

## Why do I need this?

Imagine you are working on a project and need to share the project structure and file contents with a collaborator or an **AI platform** for analysis. Instead of manually copying and pasting each file's content, you can use the files_flattener.py script to generate a single file with all the necessary information. This consolidated file can then be easily shared, ensuring that the recipient has all the context needed to understand the project.

## Example

Assume you have the following directory structure:

```
|
|--folder1
|  |--file1.txt
|  |--file2.txt
|--file3.txt
```

And you have an `.ignore` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
folder1/file2.txt

# Exclude itself
.ignore
```

Running the implementation will process the files, ignoring `folder1/file2.txt` and `.ignore` itself as specified in the `.ignore` file. The output file will contain the contents of the remaining files in the following format:

```
**folder1/file1.txt:**

[...file1.txt's content...]

**file3.txt:**

[...file3.txt's content...]
```

## Getting Started

### Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the package using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install files_flattener
   ```
3. Run the command:

   ```sh
   flt <directory> <output_file> [<ignore_file>]
   ```

   - `<directory>`: The path of the directory containing the files to be flattened.
   - `<output_file>`: The path of the output file where the contents of the files will be written.
   - `[<ignore_file>]`: (Optional) The path to a file containing patterns of files to ignore. If not provided, the script will look for a '.ignore' file in the specified directory. If the '.ignore' file is not found, no files will be ignored.

### Development

#### Install the required dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the script locally

```sh
python -m files_flattener.cli <directory> <output_file> [<ignore_file>]
```

#### Build the package

Ensure `wheel` is installed:

```sh
pip install wheel
```

Generate the distribution files:

```sh
rm -rf build/ dist/
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

#### Publish the package to PyPI

Install `twine` if you haven't already:

```sh
pip install twine
```

Upload the distribution files to PyPI:

```sh
twine upload dist/*
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add dry-run mode to preview the output before writing to the file.
- [ ] Make a web app based on Vue3.
- [x] Use `.ignore` to exclude or include files for flattening.
